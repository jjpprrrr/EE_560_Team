Prelab:
1. Before coming to lab, complete Q#6.1 on page 13 of 22 of the following practice homework
http://www-classes.usc.edu/engr/ee-s/560/EE560_HW_on_state_machine_n_data_path.pdf
In-lab:
1. Create a folder called yard_feet_inches under C:\ModelSim_projects\ 
2. Go through divider_mealy.vhd, and divider_mealy_tb.vhd in the attached .zip file. Copy these files with new names.
divider_mealy.vhd  => C:\ModelSim_projects\yard_feet_inches\yard_feet_inches.vhd
divider_mealy_tb.vhd  => C:\ModelSim_projects\yard_feet_inches\yard_feet_inches_tb.vhd 
3. Use 8-bit signals for inches, feet, yards. Edit and complete these files to suit, simulate in modelsim and demonstrate to your TA.
4. FTP your vhdl files to your UNIX account and submit them online to the ee560 class account using the following unix command:
submit -user ee560 -tag yard_feet_inches  yard_feet_inches.vhd  yard_feet_inches_output_results.txt names.txt
In the attached .zip file, there is the detailed testbench for this task. 
Files:  yard_feet_inches_long_tb_r1.vhd  yard_feet_inches_input_operands.txt
This testbench is provided for your reading as it demonstrates various methods for testing your hardware:
Testing through for loop in the test bench.
Testing through FileIO (Inputs & Outputs to/from files)
Outputs to "Transcript" Screen
